      <h1>Architecture Design</h1>

      <h2>Backend Information Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        The backend of the project was created using multiple services offered
        by Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud division of Amazon, and a
        software package called Serverless. Serverless was used to orchestrate
        these services and quickly deploy code without having to provide each
        service manually. Below is a diagram displaying the services used, how
        they link up, and a description of each service used.
      </p>

      **********IMG***************

      <h3>Cognito</h3>
      <p>
        Cognito is a user-authentication service offered by Amazon that
        abstracts away and takes care of registering, logging into, and managing
        user accounts. Cognito is needed for our system to protect the admin
        side of the system from general users.
      </p>

      <h3>API Gateway</h3>
      <p>
        API Gateway is a service that allows developers to create REST APIs to
        be used within their systems. In our case, we used API Gateway to create
        endpoints, such as getting printing service prices, for general system
        users to access. Private endpoints were also created in combination with
        Cognito that only the ITSA administration can access the admin site.
      </p>

      <h3>Lambda</h3>
      <p>
        Lambda is a service that allows pieces of code to be deployed and run
        without worrying about hosting the code. Code can be arbitrarily
        executed in a temporary environment without worrying about provisioning
        servers actually to run the code. Each API Gateway endpoint is connected
        to a snippet of code hosted in Lambda, interacting with other services
        to perform their respective tasks.
      </p>

      <h3>DynamoDB</h3>
      <p>
        DynamoDB is the primary NoSQL database service that supports key-value
        and document data structures that Amazon offers. It is a service that
        allows data to be stored and retrieved quickly and cheaply, without
        providing or managing servers for the database. DynamoDB is also much
        cheaper than the relational database services offered by Amazon. The
        information which is constantly accessed and needs to be accessed
        quickly is stored within DynamoDB, including order and article details.
        More long-term and less frequently accessed data, including article
        thumbnails and printing documents, are stored within S3.
      </p>

      <h3>S3</h3>
      <p>
        S3 is Amazon's traditional file storage system offered by Amazon. It
        allows larger blobs of data to be stored and still be accessed
        relatively quickly, without needing servers to store the data similarly
        to the other services we are using. It allows us to store larger files
        as mentioned above, including documents to be printed to be retrieved
        later. It also exposes a file access system where read/write permissions
        can be configured not just for individual files but for groups of files
        called buckets within S3. The static React website content is also
        stored within S3 so it can be quickly and cheaply accessed.
      </p>

      <h3>Simple Email Service</h3>
      <p>
        Simple Email Service (SES) is an email-sending service offered by
        Amazon. It allows emails to be sent from an authenticated address from
        Amazon's servers. By default, SES is set up in a sandbox mode where all
        sender and recipient emails must be verified to prevent abuse. However,
        the sandbox mode can be removed to send emails to any destination.
      </p>

      <h2>Frontend Information Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        The primary basis of the frontend's architecture is based on the concept
        of MVC, Model View Controller. The leading technologies used to create
        the frontend's architecture were React.js, Redux, and Redux-Saga.
      </p>

      **********IMG***************

      <p>
        The first part of the system is the view. The view is created by react,
        divided into two sections: react containers and react components. The
        React components are just for viewing and displaying the different
        subsections that appear on each page. The react container's job is only
        half for the view; they are also called smart components. This reference
        comes from the fact that the containers contain both visual aspects and
        act as the gateway between the view, model and controller. Either
        collecting data from the model or sending information from the user to
        the controller.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once input is collected from the user, it is then sent to the
        controller. Within our system, the controller is redux. Redux within
        this system, on a high-level act as both the controller and model;
        however, only the redux store handles the model section of the system.
        From the controller aspect, redux receives predefined actions from the
        react container. These actions have both a type and a payload. The type
        defines how redux should interact with the payload. The actions could be
        one of a few different types of actions. The action could be for
        modifying data within the model (adding, updating, removing), or the
        action could be for collecting data for an external server in terms of
        an API request.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a redux action is a type that requires an API request, redux sends
        that payload to redux-saga to help interact with the side-effect that
        occurs when handling asynchronous code. Any function that is within
        redux-saga follows the same basic layout: 1) set a base state within the
        system model, this could be setting the loading state to true and
        errorOccured state to false, 2) the API call itself, this includes
        preparing the data to be sent, sending/receiving the data, and
        formatting the returned data, 3) sending the received formatted data to
        the model where it can then be used to update the view of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final section of the system is the model. Compared to the view and
        controller, the model is a short section of the system. The only concern
        of the model is to store the data given to it from the controller in an
        orderly manner and retrieve the data when the view requests it. Within
        our system, the model is divided into subsections: articles,
        authentication, documents, errors, orders, and printing service prices.
