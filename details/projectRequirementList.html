      <h2>Final System vs Initial Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        The final version of the ITSA Print shop met almost all of the
        requirements set out at the beginning of the project. Certain
        requirements were changed, removed or expanded upon as detailed in the
        section above. Most functionalities remained the same for the print shop
        other than customer accounts being removed. Other additions to the
        system came from the need for quality of life improvements both for
        customers and print shop workers, such as automated email for both the
        admins and customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The decision was also made to redesign the main ITSA website, which
        added multiple new requirements, such as the addition of articles. When
        compared against the original 21 requirements submitted, the system has
        met 14 of the initial requirements. 3 out of 6 of the nice to have
        requirements were implemented, and 1 out of 1 stretch goal was
        implemented. The requirements not present are mostly related to customer
        account functionality. The final list of requirements reflect a better
        state of the system as many additions as well as a few removals,
        bringing the final total requirements up to 28 between the functional
        and non-functional requirements
